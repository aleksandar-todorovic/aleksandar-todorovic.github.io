These are the core principles which I use across my projects:

1. **Everything in the open**
  * My websites are open sourced
  * My articles are released under a Creative Commons license
  * My projects are open sourced
2. **Private and decentralized**
  * No third-party cookies (and no cookie warnings to EU citizens)
  * Data hosted on a dedicated server (with proper backups)
  * Don't wish to be tracked? This website respects [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/).
3. **Giving back**
  * I donate to other projects
  * I do simple website designs for other projects
  * I have translated a bunch of software to my native language(s)
  *
