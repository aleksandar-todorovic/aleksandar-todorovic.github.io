I've started by giving some small contributions to [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [awesome-scifi](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi). Then, the whole thing exploded and I was making my own awesome lists (like [awesome-linux](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-linux) and [awesome-c](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c)) and later on becoming one of the maintainers of the maintainers of [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) (currently #23 most starred repository on GitHub) and [awesome-scifi](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi) and [awesome-atom](https://github.com/mehcode/awesome-atom/). I have also donated `awesomelists.me` domain to the [awesome-search](https://github.com/lockys/awesome-search) project.

[OCCRP.org](https://www.occrp.org/en)'s [tech team](https://tech.occrp.org/) deals with some crazy shit at work. So, why not blog about it? We've created our own blog using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) as our preferred static site generator because it allows us to build our blog in less than a second.
