* **EVS Looking to Future: Springbos 2015** (April 10th 2015 - May 9th 2015) - I spent a month volunteering in the Netherlands as part of the [European Voluntery Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Voluntary_Service) project that took place in two cities (Rijswijk and Amsterdam). There I helped the [Don Bosco Youth Center](http://donboscorijswijk.nl/) to create a fresh and interesting program for children (aged 7-13). We did all sorts of activities which I summarized in a [blog post](https://r3bl.me/en/evs-netherlands-experience/). As a reward for my participation, I received a highly valued [Youthpass certificate](/assets/youthpass-certificate.pdf).
* **No Hate Online - No Hate Offline Workshops** (November and December 2014) - I participated in the workshops organized to support the [No Hate Speech Movement](http://nohatespeechmovement.org/).

* **Terrain work during the floods in Bosnia & Herzegovina** (May 2014) - I helped people whose lives were in danger during catastrophic floods that hit my country in 2014. We created improvised dams to stop the water from doing even more damage, and helped those who lost their homes to get back on their feet. We also managed donations we received from other countries.
