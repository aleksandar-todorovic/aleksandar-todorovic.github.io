### Writing Experience

* Running a personal [blog](https://r3bl.github.io) for almost a year now. I have a modest success in running it, with ~150 daily visitors.
* Providing content for [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com) on a regular basis. My first post ([A beginner's guide to GitHub](http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github)) written in February 2015 has been selected as [the top article of the week](http://opensource.com/life/15/2/top-5-articles-week-february-20) and became the [top article posted in that month](http://opensource.com/community-report-march-2015).
* Collaborating with the blog [Kompjuteraš](http://kompjuteras.com), writing content in Bosnian language to promote open source software.
* I used to collaborate with the regional free software magazine called [LiBRE!](https://libre.lugons.org) as a part of their editorial team. I wrote eight articles for their magazine during a one year long span.

### Volunteering Experience

* **Opensource.com Community Moderator** (June 1st 2015 - present) - In June I’ve started volunteering for [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com) (brand sponsored by the company [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/en)) as their new Community Moderator. I made a one year long commitment to provide them with the regular content for their site. I’m also in charge of moderating the comments section on the articles published on their website. You can find me on the [Meet the team](https://opensource.com/opensourcecom-team) page.
* **EVS Looking to Future: Springbos 2015** (April 10th 2015 - May 9th 2015) - I spent a month volunteering in the Netherlands as a part of the [European Voluntery Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Voluntary_Service) project that took place in two cities: Rijswijk and Amsterdam. There, I helped the [Don Bosco Youth Center](http://donboscorijswijk.nl/) to create fresh and interesting program for the children (aged 7-13). We did all sorts of activities, so I wrote a [blog post](http://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/) summarizing the project. As a reward for my participation, I received a highly valued [YouthPass certificate](https://www.youthpass.eu/en/youthpass/) (unfortunately, it is not possible to get the signed digital version of the certificate) and I'm now recognized as a volunteer of the European Union.
* **No Hate Online - No Hate Offline Workshops** (November and December 2014) - I have been a part of the workshops organized in the support of the [No Hate Speech Movement](http://nohatespeechmovement.org/). The workshops were organized by the [PRONI Center for Youth Development](http://nohatespeechmovement.org/). In them, we discussed the ways of fighting against the hate speech in the online era and did our best to reduce the hate speech in our local community.
* **Terrain work during the floods in Bosnia & Herzegovina** (May 2014) - I helped those whose lives were in danger during catastrophic floods that hit my country. We created improvised dams to stop the water from doing even more damage and helped those who lost their homes to get back on their feet. We also organized the donations we received from other countries.
