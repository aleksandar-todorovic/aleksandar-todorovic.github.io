## awesome lists

I've started by giving some small contributions to [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [awesome-scifi](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi). Then, the whole thing exploded and I was making my own awesome lists (like [awesome-linux](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-linux) (~900 stars) and [awesome-c](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c) (~700 stars)) and later on becoming one of the maintainers of [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) (~65k stars), [awesome-scifi](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi) (~1.4k stars) and [awesome-atom](https://github.com/mehcode/awesome-atom/) (~1.4k stars).

## Net neutralnost

[Net neutralnost](https://netneutralnost.com/) was an online protest in which about a dozen of sites from my region (Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia) decided to spend a day to spark the story about net neutrality in our local region. I've started the action, wrote the content on the website, coordinated the shutdown, coordinated the social campaign, and wrote a couple of articles to the websites that agreed to enter the action.  

## Battery API

[Battery](https://r3bl.me/battery/) is a very simple web page that shows you the battery status of your device by using the Battery Status API. Compatible with Chrome and Firefox (on desktop and Android). Code available [here](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/battery).

[OCCRP.org](https://www.occrp.org/en)'s [tech team](https://tech.occrp.org/) deals with some crazy shit at work. So, why not blog about it? During my time at OCCRP, we've created our own blog using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) as our preferred static site generator.
