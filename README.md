## Metadata 
 
* **Project purpose:** My personal homepage. 
* **License:** MIT license. 
* **Built using:** Jekyll. 
* **Repository mirrors:** [GitHub](https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.me), [Gitea](https://code.r3bl.tech/sites/r3bl.me) (self-hosted) 
 
### Worth noting 
 
* **Should you fork this repository?** Probably not. However, there are some snippets in the code base that you might want to use. If you decide to do so, a shotout with a link is appreciated (not a requirement). 
* **Is the project reproducible?** Thanks to my particular setup, I don't really test if the project is reproducible. If you stumble upon a problem, feel free to create an issue. 
* **Why multiple mirrors?** 
    * GitHub mirror: because it's what people are used to. 
    * Gitea mirror: because I don't feel completely comfortable with Microsoft hosting the only copy of the project. 
* **Where to report issues?** Any of the two issue trackers. I'm checking both. Feel free to ping me if I don't get back to you after some time. 
 
## How to build it 
 
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Install [`bundler`](https://bundler.io/#getting-started). 
3. Run `bundle install` from the project directory. 
4. Run `bundle install jekyll serve`. 
5. Visit `localhost:4000` inside of your favorite browser. 
 
## Credits 
 
While this website was based off of [Neo-HPSTR](http://aronbordin.com/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/) Jekyll theme, over time I've made enough granular changes to the code base that it's unrecognizable.
