## Metadata

* **Project purpose:** My personal homepage.
* **License:** MIT license.
* **Built using:** Jekyll.
* **Repository mirrors:** [GitHub](https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.me), [Gitea](https://code.r3bl.tech/sites/r3bl.me) (self-hosted)

## Worth noting

* **Should you fork this repository?** Probably not. However, there are some snippets in the code base that you might want to use. If you decide to do so, a shotout with a link is appreciated (not a requirement).
* **Is the project reproducible?** Thanks to my particular setup, I don't really test if the project is reproducible. If you stumble upon a problem, feel free to create an issue.
* **Why multiple mirrors?**
    * GitHub mirror: because it's what people are used to.
    * Gitea mirror: because I don't feel completely comfortable with Microsoft hosting the only copy of the project.
* **Where to report issues?** Any of the two issue trackers. I'm checking both. Feel free to ping me if I don't get back to you after some time.
* **How do I use this repository?** I use it to sync files from my development machine to my server and vice versa. I almost always push directly to the master branch directly since it's a one-man project.
* **Why multiple domains?** Because I like it. It probably does have a negative impact on SEO, but I don't rely on search engines for most of my traffic.
* **Does the website track users?** Only those who haven't turned on the Do Not Track header and don't have EasyPrivacy filter enabled in their adblocker. For further info, check out my [privacy policy](https://r3bl.blog/en/privacy-policy/).
